# Weight Tracker Vue Application

### I learned how to create a weight tracker app using the Vue framework! 
* Learned from Tyler Potts (youtube) - This was only to learn the foundations of Vue. Once I got a good grasp of it, I then changed the styling and added more features such as state management and added a reset button. I may plan to create a login and registration to create users that can store their weight history. I also am planning on deploying it through Netlify for my personal use.
