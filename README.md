# Weight Tracker Vue Application

### I learned how to create a weight tracker app using the Vue framework! 
* A one page weight tracker application.  I wanted to learn the foundations of Vue as a framework. I followed the start of a into to Vue.js Course on you tube by a developer named Tyler Potts. Once I got a good grasp of the framework, I then changed the styling and added more features such as state management and added a reset button. I may plan to create a login and registration to create users that can store their weight history. I also am planning on deploying it through Netlify for my personal use.
